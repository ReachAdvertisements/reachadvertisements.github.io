The involuntary collection of data continues and companies receive more and more information about people in exchange for the mephistophelian services these companies provide. Companies such as Facebook, Google's Alphabet and their joined venture Palantir whose sole purpose is the collection of everyones data to be able to sell their advertisements better, in the best case scenario.

Imagine the future of the internet if everything keeps going the way it is going right now. The involuntary collection of data continues and companies receive more and more information about people in exchange for the mephistophelian services these companies provide. Companies such as Facebook, Google's Alphabet and their joined venture Palantir whose sole purpose is the collection of everyones data to be able to sell their advertisements better, in the best case scenario.

We would find ourselves living in a world where nothing on the internet is free, it is paid for by giving up your privacy. We would be living in a world where you as an individual no longer have any control over who is able to see how and when you use the services or products you use. To most people, this slow encroaching on our privacy of big companies and governmenst is too inconspicuous to even worry about. Why would they worry if they have nothing to hide? Unfortunately, this line of reasoning never holds up if you look at the natural state of human beings congregating together in cities and bigger settlements. Privacy is a basic protection against the bigotry of your neighbours, it is the buffer that provides the tolerance that is needed in a free and multi-ethnic and cultural nation state.

We know for a fact that we here at Reach cannot fix these problems for the entire world and the claim to be able to do so or even make an impact would be extremely arrogant coming from fresh faces in the industry like ours. We also know without a shred of a doubt that our team and leadership is commited to building a new advertisement network that does take into account peoples concerns with these issues. We are driven to come up with a way in this new ecosystem that is forming between netizens to provide ad supported content without the need or want for unwanted data collection. Data collection can be done with consent of the public and simultaniously show the same public that the data they give is not worthless. The services they receive are not worth the privacy they give up. The future of the old system is a return to the past: complete overlordship on the basis of a power imbalance. Tech companies will know everything about you, yet you know nothing about said tech companies because they are accutely aware of the power imbalance you put yourself in if you give away so much information.

The future of our new system to monetize content together with the many alternatives that have started to sprout up around the cryptosphere is that we want to put the power back into the hands of the people. Not in a communist way, Reach will be a commercial company making money for its shareholders. Not in a hippy way, we realise money has to be made and online advertising and the need for data driven advertisement will not go away. We want to put the power back into the hands of the people as a way to be a better company. We want to make more money serving advertisements to the web than the old companies because we are simply not forcing our consumers to choose between using a service and giving up their privacy or not using a service. We want to rebrand tech firms as not being the nefarious and unknowable molochs they are now, and present them once again as the innovators and forerunners of progress.

We want to be a trustless organisation as far as possible, where the salaries, dividends and stakeholders are all out in the open. Not just from day one, but until the court of conscience.

I will leave you for today with the following quote:

A merchant who approaches business with the idea of serving the public well has nothing to fear from the competition.
